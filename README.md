# MSA-HMM-Analysis

This repository contains materials suitable to reproduce the comparative experiments for our MSA-HMM alignments. In particular:

- scripts to automatically download HomFam, BaliFam and our ultra large datasets
- scripts to run MSA-HMM as well as Clustal Omega (http://www.clustal.org/omega/#Download), MAGUS (https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUS), UPP (https://github.com/smirarab/sepp), t_coffee regressive (https://www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcoffee/index.html#DOWNLOAD) and mafft sparsecore (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) on all datasets 
- evaluation scripts and code to generate all figures

This repository does neither contain our own tool MSA-HMM (todo: link) nor third party software, which has to be installed separately following the respective install instructions.
